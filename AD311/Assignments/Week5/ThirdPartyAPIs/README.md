# Integrating Third-Party APIs
This project is for learning how to fetch data from third-party APIs using JavaScript.

A user can use this application to generate a random Dungeons & Dragons character. They receive information covering rules for a random race, class, and alignment.

To try out the project, run **npm start** in a console at the root folder.
